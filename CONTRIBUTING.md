# Contributing to Meetingnotes

I anticipate the main users of this app to be technical, given the need to bring your own API key.

As you use the app, you will come across bugs and have desires for new features. It is my hope that you will then be eager to contribute to improve the app.

Since you're here, maybe that's you! Please take a moment to read this guide before making a pull request.

Rules:

- Be respectful
- Open an issue first for major changes
- Use conventional commits
