I want to build an open source version of Granola

It will be a meeting notetaking macOS application

Basically it will use your mic and system audio, create a live transcript, and then at the end of the meeting use the transcript + any notes you write in a notepad to generate the meeting notes, with a button to quickly copy the notes or transcript. Can also edit the resulting notes

The user will provide their own deepgram and openai API keys (stored locally) for transcription and AI generation

The user will also be able to modify the system prompt in addition to just being able to write a blurb about themself (that gets injected into the system prompt)

All data will be stored locally on the device

That will be great for the MVP to start. Later on I will add additional features such as:
- connecting to your Google calendar
- note templates
- AI chat for asking questions about a meeting
- Integrations for email, slack, etc.
